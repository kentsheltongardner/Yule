## Light and dark
In the castle? there are light and dark regions, and the player may move through tunnels from one region to the other. When the player moves from dark to light or vice versa, the currently empty region becomes solid, and the currently solid region becomes empty.

## Tunnels
Tunnels allow the player to move from light to dark regions. They are 1x1 blocks that can be vertically or horizontally traversed. The player shifts to a new region when he moves out of a tunnel, while not holding a light or dark block.

## Beams
Beams pierce and kill the player. They can pass through tunnels when axially aligned with them.

## Spikes
Spikes will kill the player if the player touches them.
